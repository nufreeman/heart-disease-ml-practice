## 📚 About This Project
This project is a practical notebook focusing on heart disease risk analysis. It walks you through the steps of exploring data, preprocessing it, and applying classic machine learning techniques. It's designed for educational purposes and is not suitable for clinical use.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started, you'll need to download the application from our Releases page. This is an easy process and requires no technical background.

### Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand the dataset and its characteristics.
- **Preprocessing:** Learn how to prepare data for analysis.
- **Machine Learning Baselines:** Use scikit-learn to implement classic machine learning models.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of your models.
- **Reproducibility:** Ensure that your results can be replicated.

## 🖥️ System Requirements
Before downloading, please ensure that your computer meets the following minimum requirements:
- **Operating System:** Windows 10, macOS, or Linux
- **RAM:** At least 4GB
- **Storage Space:** 1GB free disk space
